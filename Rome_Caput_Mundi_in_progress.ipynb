To do this will be taken into account the real air pollution data of Rome thank to different main control units located on the ground. \n",

    "Unfortunately or fortunately air **pollution varies day-by-day and zone-by-zone** depending of the period of the year, of the number of automobiles, houses heating, farm animals (it sound strange but is's true...), and so on. For these reasons we decided that only the first three (with less **PM10** values) control units will be choosen. The geographical coordinates of those control units will be crossed with the geographical coordinates of the neighborhoods in order to get all bar and choose the best three.\n",
